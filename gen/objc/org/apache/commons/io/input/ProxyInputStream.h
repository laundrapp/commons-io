/*!
 @brief A Proxy stream which acts as expected, that is it passes the method
  calls on to the proxied stream and doesn't change which methods are
  being called.
 <p>
  It is an alternative base class to FilterInputStream
  to increase reusability, because FilterInputStream changes the
  methods being called, such as read(byte[]) to read(byte[], int, int). 
 <p>
  See the protected methods for ways in which a subclass can easily decorate
  a stream with custom pre-, post- or error processing functionality.
